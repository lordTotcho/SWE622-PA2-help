This is the basic overview to get RMI way of doing things to work for PA2

I left comments in all of the files to help you getting the feel of how it works

Here are the steps to execute the code in your IDE:
* In the directory where your compiled java files(.class) run the rmiregistry command( for windows is start rmiregistry )
* Run the Server class
* Run the Client class

## What  is happening?
* Client calls the sayHello() function
* The ServerImpl some how gets called and performs the logic for the sayHello()
